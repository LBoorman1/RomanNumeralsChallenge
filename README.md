# RomanNumeralsChallenge
Basic roman numerals coding challenge.

# Challenge
Very similar to yesterday's ATM challenge. I used the same tree map principle to organise my keys in descending order, however, this time, looking at the documentation,
I found a ".descendingKeySet" method which got rid of the need for importing the comparator class.

I struggled with finding an efficient and not complex way to avoid hard coding the values for 4, 9, 40 etc.
